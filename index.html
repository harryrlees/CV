With a proven track record of managing junior staff and engaging with clients, I possess excellent leadership and communication skills. Now, I am seeking a career change to leverage my technical expertise and project management abilities as a Technical Project Manager. With my attention to detail, analytical mindset, and dedication to delivering successful outcomes, I am ready to apply my skills in overseeing and coordinating complex technical projects to drive organizational growth and achieve strategic objectives.
